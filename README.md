# Message-Encode-Decode

A simple python project which shows the encryption and decryption of messages in a GUI format.</br>
This is my first project in Collegeüè´</br>
The idea of this project comes from Whatsapp that it shows at the top</br>

<q>
  Messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted.</br>
  No one outside of this chat, not even Whatsapp can read or listen to them.
